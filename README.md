# Python_Learning

A repository to showcase what did I learn while taking the Python Course at RRC.

## Week 1

In the first week of the course we learned about the basic data-types in Python that includes
the integers, floats, strings, lists, tuples and dictionaries. We got to know about the common
methods used to manipulate the data with these datatypes such as "range", "round" for numbers.
"strip", "replace", "len" for strings. The some useful methods for dictionaries, tuples and lists;
such as "append", "pop".

Later we got to work on an assignment where we worked with API to fetch the data.
The assignment was using the API of "Winnipeg Transit" we needed to get the stops from a specified
area and then user will choose a stop_numner of his interest and then the program will show him
the route-plan for that particular stop. Along with that we learned to color-code the output.
It was a fun assignment!

## Week_2

In the second week we build upon our learning from firsrt week, worked a little more with **python datastructures** and countiuned working with the **APIs**. For the seocnd assignment we worked on an
assignment where we used **API** for **NASA's Rovers**. We basically got all the rovers and then as per
the date eneterd by user we showed the pictures of the rover for that date if there were some picture
or a message if there were no pictures. But the fun part or the addition here was we were using Menu's.
Basically we used a third party module/library and used it in our program. It was a little head-scratchy
momemt to work with that as the documenation for Menu's code was little vague but the end result was so
good. We handled the errors too by learning the try-catch concept and of cource these two assignments
helped in building some familiarity with conditionals and for loops in python.
