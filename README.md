# Python_Learning:
A repository to showcase what did I learn while taking the Python Course at RRC.

# Week 1:

In the first week of the course we learned about the basic data-types in Python that includes
the integers, floats, strings, lists, tuples and dictionaries. We got to know about the common
methods used to manipulate the data with these datatypes such as "range", "round" for numbers.
"strip", "replace", "len" for strings. The some useful methods for dictionaries, tuples and lists;
such as "append", "pop".

Later we got to work on an assignment where we worked with API to fetch the data.
The assignment was using the API of "Winnipeg Transit" we needed to get the stops from a specified
area and then user will choose a stop_numner of his interest and then the program will show him
the route-plan for that particular stop. Along with that we learned to color-code the output.
It was a fun assignment!
